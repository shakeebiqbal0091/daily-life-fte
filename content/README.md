# Content Directory

This directory stores all generated output from the Daily Life Productivity Digital FTE system. Content is created by agents and workflows and is safe to delete and regenerate.

## Purpose

The content directory contains human-readable, reviewable output that results from system operations. This includes:

- Social media posts generated by the Content Creator skill
- Email drafts and sent emails from the Email Manager skill
- Structured reports from workflows and agents

## Content vs State

### Content (This Directory)
- Generated output only
- Human-readable and reviewable
- Safe to delete and regenerate
- No logic or workflows
- Auto-saved by hooks

### State (../.claude/state/)
- System operational data
- Agent coordination information
- Task and workflow tracking
- Not human-readable
- Critical for system operation

## Auto-Save Hooks

The system includes auto-save hooks that automatically save content after generation:

- `auto-save-content.sh`: Saves content after creation
- `evening-summary.sh`: Archives daily content
- `weekly-review.sh`: Compiles weekly reports

## Directory Structure

```

## Content Metadata

Each content file should include metadata at the top:

```markdown

generated_by: "Content Creator Agent"
status: "draft"
related_workflow: "morning-routine"
