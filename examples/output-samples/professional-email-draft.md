Hi Jane,

I hope you're having a productive week. I wanted to follow up on the Q2 marketing strategy proposal we submitted on February 10th regarding your company's digital transformation initiative.

Our team has been reviewing your recent LinkedIn posts and industry news, and we're excited about the alignment between your vision and our proposed approach. The data-driven customer segmentation strategy we outlined could potentially increase your conversion rates by 25-30% based on similar implementations we've executed.

I'd love to schedule a 30-minute call next week to:
1. Address any questions about the proposal
2. Discuss potential timeline adjustments based on your current priorities
3. Explore additional opportunities for synergy between our teams

Would you be available for a call on:
- Tuesday, February 18th at 2:00 PM EST
- Wednesday, February 19th at 10:00 AM EST
- Thursday, February 20th at 3:00 PM EST

Please let me know which time works best for you, or if there are other times that would be more convenient.

Looking forward to continuing our conversation.

Best regards,
Alex Smith
Digital Marketing Strategist
Digital Agency Inc.
