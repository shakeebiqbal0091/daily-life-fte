# Daily Life FTE (Digital Full‑Time Employee)

An **agentic AI productivity system** that acts as a **Digital Full‑Time Employee** for managing daily life: planning, learning, health, finance, content creation, and continuous self‑improvement.

This project is **architecture‑first**, privacy‑aware, and designed around modern agentic AI principles (agents, skills, workflows, state, monitoring, and integrations).

---

## 🚀 What Is Daily Life FTE?

**Daily Life FTE** is a modular AI system that simulates a *full‑time personal assistant*.
Instead of isolated prompts, it uses:

* Specialized **agents**
* Reusable **skills**
* Time‑based and event‑based **workflows**
* Persistent **state & memory**
* Measurable **monitoring & metrics**
* Optional **external integrations (MCP servers)**

The result is an AI system that can **plan, act, track, and improve** over time.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🧠 **Agentic Architecture** – Multiple specialized agents working together
* 🛠 **Skill‑Driven Execution** – Clear separation between reasoning and actions
* ⏰ **Daily / Weekly / Monthly Workflows** – Real life automation
* 📊 **Monitoring & Metrics** – Track time saved, usage, and quality
* 🔐 **Privacy‑First Design** – Personal data is local and git‑ignored
* 📁 **Portfolio‑Ready Outputs** – Real examples of AI‑generated work
* 🔌 **Extensible Integrations** – Gmail, Calendar, Notion, Search, etc.

## 🧑‍💻 Agents Overview

The system includes specialized agents such as:

* **Content Creator Agent** – Emails, social posts, documents
* **Learning Assistant Agent** – Notes, research, study planning
* **Health Coach Agent** – Fitness, habits, wellness tracking
* **Finance Manager Agent** – Budgeting and expense tracking
* **Personal Organizer Agent** – Tasks, planning, scheduling

Each agent uses shared skills but operates with a focused responsibility.

## 🔁 Workflows (Real‑Life Usage)

### Daily

* Morning Routine (planning & priorities)
* Work Preparation
* Lunch Check‑in
* Evening Wrap‑up

### Weekly

* Weekly Planning
* Weekly Review

### Monthly

* Monthly Reflection & progress analysis

These workflows allow the system to function like a **real employee with routines**.

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Feedback

The system tracks:

* Daily productivity metrics
* Skill usage frequency
* Estimated time saved
* Output quality scores

This enables **continuous optimization** of both the AI system and personal habits.

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Data Ownership

* Personal data is stored locally in `/data/`
* The data directory is **git‑ignored**
* No cloud sync by default
* User controls the entire data lifecycle

This makes the system suitable for **personal, professional, and enterprise‑style use**.

---

## 🧪 Examples & Portfolio

The `/examples` directory contains **curated, anonymized outputs** that demonstrate:

* Real emails and content drafts
* Planning and review reports
* Research summaries
* Health & finance snapshots (mocked)

These examples prove **real autonomy**, not just prompt engineering.

---

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open it in Claude Code / CCR
3. Follow `CLAUDE.md` strictly
4. Run daily workflows (morning & evening)
5. Interact naturally throughout the day

Over time, the system becomes your **AI life manager**.

---
